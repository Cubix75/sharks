   Sharks are the "terrors" of the sea. Even though these rough skinned fish are the apex predators of the oceanic food chain, they barely harm humans and are completely misunderstood. UNTIL <strong>NOW</strong>. Scientists are teaching people how wrong we were just a mere 20 years ago. Now there are efforts to save these majestic creatures.

                           <h3>General Facts about Sharks</h3>
                           <br>
                           <p>
                           Sharks are made mostly of cartilage and have rough skin. They are 375 species of these cold-blooded creatures. Sharks appeared before <em>dinosaurs</em> and can eat almost anything. A license plate was once reported being found in a shark's stomach once! Sharks also have receptors that sense electric signals coming from other animals. This is very handy as they can find prey easily. Most sharks live in the ocean but some have adapted to living in freshwater! Another example of sharks adapting is that some species of sharks have a bite force that can crush ten cars! But before you switch your species to a shark, note that most sharks must swim endlessly, 24/7, to stay alive and not drown. Why?, you may ask. The reason is that they must have a constant supply of water going through their mouth and passing through their gills so they can get oxygen. Here are some species related shark facts: <br></p/>

<h3>
  Great White Sharks
  </h3>
  <br>
    <p>
                           Great White Sharks are probably the most famous sharks. They can weight 2 tons, swim 10,000 miles a year, have over 300 teeth. They are feared the most but barely bite because they live mostly in the deep. They are the largest predatory fish and can go through 30,000 teeth over their lifetime.

   <h3>Sharks and Humans</h3>
   <p>
    One of the worst things that humans do to sharks is that they make shark fin soup. The way fishers obtain fins is they catch a shark, cut off it's fins, and throw it back into the water. Because the shark cannot swim, it cannot get water into its gills and it dies of drowning. And since some shark fishing boats can catch 100 sharks in a day, it's no surprise when <em>100,000</em> sharks are killed each year (it actually is kind've a surprise for me, but whatever). Humans have also found out that sharks are very smart. They have been trained to swim through mazes, ring bells, and press targets for rewards. Now, to bites. First, only 2 dozen sharks are actually dangerous to humans. Only 100 people are bit each year out of the 75,000,000 people who go the beach each year. Most of those bites are not fatal. The three species of sharks that bite humans the most are the tiger, the great white, and the bull shark. The most shark bites happen in florida.
