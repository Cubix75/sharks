   Sharks are the "terrors" of the sea. Even though these rough skinned fish are the apex predators of the oceanic food chain, they barely harm humans and are completely misunderstood. UNTIL <strong>NOW</strong>. Scientists are teaching people how wrong we were just a mere 20 years ago. Now there are efforts to save these majestic creatures.

                           <h3>General Facts about Sharks</h3>
                           <p>
                           Sharks are made mostly of cartilage and have rough skin. They are 375 species of these cold-blooded creatures. Sharks appeared before <em>dinosaurs</em> and can eat almost anything. A license plate was once reported being found in a shark's stomach once! Sharks also have receptors that sense electric signals coming from other animals. This is very handy as they can find prey easily. Most sharks live in the ocean but some have adapted to living in freshwater! Another example of sharks adapting is that some species of sharks have a bite force that can crush ten cars! But before you switch your species to a shark, note that most sharks must swim endlessly, 24/7, to stay alive and not drown. Why?, you may ask. The reason is that they must have a constant supply of water going through their mouth and passing through their gills so they can get oxygen. Here are some species related shark facts: <br>
