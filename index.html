   Sharks are the "terrors" of the sea. Even though these rough skinned fish are the apex predators of the oceanic food chain, they barely harm humans and are completely misunderstood. UNTIL <strong>NOW</strong>. Scientists are teaching people how wrong we were just a mere 20 years ago. Now there are efforts to save these majestic creatures.

  Great White Sharks

    <p>
                           Great White Sharks are probably the most famous sharks. They can weight 2 tons, swim 10,000 miles a year, have over 300 teeth. They are feared the most but barely bite because they live mostly in the deep. They are the largest predatory fish and can go through 30,000 teeth over their lifetime.
